HodgkinsHuxleyModel
===================

This code simulates the basic Hodgkins Huxley Model.

The basic code simulates a simplified, functional neuron response, without any external stimulation (no injected current).
Problem2 simulates the the same neuron response with a step pulse of 5 uA/cm^2 for the first .5 ms.
Problem3 simulates the same neuron response with a constant current of 5 uA/cm^s.
